# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kick start your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidelines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742485.aspx Icons that are recognizable
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The login page needs a unifying universal/ well known logo to represent the school, the existing one is can use some work but it is recognizable. Users will understand this logo/icon instantaneously. The icon should also take advantage of the P3 color space which will produce more rich and saturated colors and is supported on more devices at this time.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-style Layout Styles and touch targets
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Touch targets are bigger than the buttons themselves for accessibility reasons (larger spectrum of users, such as children with developing motor skills).  

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-touch-target-size Vertical Spacing
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Ample spacing for interactive elements. These elements are spaced at 10dp.
