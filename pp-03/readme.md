+## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text http://paletton.com/

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform
Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14V0u0kwnvGibzCn6uauBmoArhr
Your Rationale: Needed to be different from competing platforms (PlayStation-blue, Xbox-green, Nintendo-White, black, red). Light enough to be inviting but dark enough to not be hot pink which makes it more universal.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens
Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52Q0w0kE8y4fRylkMsysgkVxqfU
Your Rationale: Natural Colors to resemble plant life, blue in the palette can be used for water for the tour’s advertisement.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet
Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33x0O0kwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX
Your Rationale: The colors “pop” to keep the kids’ attention. It’s a simple yet bright color palette for building on the taught/familiar primary colors and building upon that with alphabet letters.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity
Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=a2P000knZr+exDGjGuXrRnJu+iT
Your Rationale: The small red portion of this palette symbolizes the virus and the green demonstrates the solution to the virus in this advertisement. I decided to this because red symbolizing a virus and green demonstrating protection is engrained in culture and other popular anti-virus program giving this ad familiarity. However, I didn’t use the traditional red and green colors and have opted for a more friendly brighter pastel for “friendliness” and familiarity but not obscurity with other well-known anti-virus solutions.
